# module_3_challenge
build array of object for collecting employee data. Realized I needed to return the employeeArr; in order for the 
code to display the html.

working on adding isNaN to logic to make sure salary is digits. 

added displayAverageSalary for loop, and the average salary is incorrect
debugger not working on file, need to check on it later and moved on. 

bug: Only displaying the last employee data entered in all cells

added getRandomEmployee logic

Fixed logic to get in order for multiple employee objects would be created.
